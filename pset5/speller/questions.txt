1. What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?

    A synonym for silicosis, a lung disease caused by inhaling quartz dust, that was invented to be an artificially long word.

2. According to its man page, what does getrusage do?

    Returns information about system resource usage in the form of a data structure, rusage, with various pieces of performance information.

3. Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?

    Sixteen

4. Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?

    Because the argument calls for a pointer and passing by reference is faster since it is being called multiple times with different values returned each time.

5. Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.

    TODO

6. Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?

    By reading words one character at a time, you have better control over disregarding numbers and other characters, as well as controlling aspects like length and placement of apostrophes.

7. Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?

    Because the same block of memory (an array for the word and a file for the dictionary) are being used each time the function is called, so even though values are changing, the pointer is constant.
